### Introduction

The release of **Refine v5** is just around the corner, and with it comes official support for **React 19**. While React 19 has been available for some time, its adoption into the Refine ecosystem marks a significant milestone. This update will unlock a new set of powerful tools and patterns for building sophisticated, high-performance applications.

To help you get ready, we're revisiting the key features that React 19 brought to the table. Think of this as a practical guide to the tools you'll soon be using every day within your Refine projects. From the game-changing Actions paradigm to streamlined form handling and server components, let's dive in.

**What we'll cover:**

- The New "Actions" Paradigm
- Brand New Hooks: `useActionState`, `useOptimistic`, and `use`
- Major Improvements to Forms and `ref`
- The Stabilization of React Server Components
- Why This Matters for Refine Developers

## The New "Actions" Paradigm

One of the most significant additions in React 19 is **Actions**, a new feature designed to simplify the process of handling data mutations and state updates. Previously, developers had to manually manage pending states, errors, and optimistic updates when submitting data, often leading to complex and boilerplate-heavy code.

Actions streamline this entire process by integrating `async` functions directly into the transition system. This allows React to automatically handle the pending states, errors, and even form resets for you.

Consider a simple form to update a user's name.

**Before Actions**, you would manage the loading and error states yourself:

```javascript
// Before Actions
function UpdateName({}) {
  const [name, setName] = useState("");
  const [error, setError] = useState(null);
  const [isPending, setIsPending] = useState(false);

  const handleSubmit = async () => {
    setIsPending(true);
    const error = await updateName(name);
    setIsPending(false);
    if (error) {
      setError(error);
      return;
    }
    redirect("/path");
  };

  //...
}
```
